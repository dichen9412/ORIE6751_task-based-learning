# Comparison of Task-based Learning Models for News Vender Problem

This repository is used to compare the two methods in
[Task-based End-to-end Model Learning in Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04529) 
and 
[Task-Based Learning via Task-Oriented Prediction Network with Applications in Finance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09357) 
using the News Vender Problem as the dataset.

Run Task_based_learning/main.py to generate results for all models.

If you find this repository helpful in your publications,
please consider citing these two papers.
